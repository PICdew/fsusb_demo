This is a quick hack to be able to talk to the 
Microchip PICDEM FS USB Demo Board from Linux.

Its based on the usb_pickit1 code and thus makes use of the libusb.
(I used libusb 0.1.10a)

               (port to Windows using libusb_win32 and MinGW, added --help)
               Bill Freeman: improved temperature conversion
	      

Web: http://www.varxec.net/picdem_fs_usb/


the following options are recognized:
--ledon <lednumber>     turns a LED on
--ledoff <lednumber>    turns a LED off
--reset                 resets the board
--readpot               reads the potentiometer value
--readtemp              reads the temperature

Only one of these options can be specified due to the very simple commandline
parsing currently implemented.

Valid lednumbers are 3 and 4 (a limitation of the board firmware).

The temperature calculation is still off (at least in the neg. degrees 
celcius range)
